Categorical variables like neighbourhood_group_cleansed, room_type, and instant_bookable will be one-hot encoded. Numerical features will be normalized to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is crucial for models like linear regression and neural networks.\n",

    "To train the model, I will start by splitting the data into training and test sets with an 80/20 split. I will employ k-fold cross-validation (e.g., k=5) on the training data to assess model performance and detect overfitting. The evaluation metrics will include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance. Visualization techniques such as plotting actual vs. predicted prices and residual plots will be used to identify patterns and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, I will conduct hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the selected models. Feature importance will be assessed to remove less significant features, reducing overfitting and enhancing model performance. I will consider ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models, potentially improving accuracy. If linear models are used, regularization techniques like Lasso or Ridge regression will be applied to prevent overfitting."
