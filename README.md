# Final Project for Break Through Tech AI
As an AI/ML fellow of Break Through Tech AI, MIT cohort I developed this Machine Learning Prediction model to implements a machine learning pipeline to predict Airbnb listing prices. This program loads and preprocess the data from the dataset, then evaluates the importance of each feature using mutual information scores. The top features are selected based on their scores, and a RandomForestRegressor model is trained on these selected features to make predictions.
